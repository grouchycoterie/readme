Hi, Welcome to Indeed University. IU is an incredible opportunity to jumpstart your career at Indeed. I am so excited to have you here.

This document is to improve our working relationship. This is my first experience as manager. Much of this is new to me. My hope is that this document will help give you an idea of what to expect with me as your IU lead.

# My Job(s)
As an IU Lead, my goal is for you to grow professionally over the course of IU.

Here are some of my responsibilities:
* Be there for you
* Teach you how to identify underlying user problems
* Teach you how to design, build, and measure products
* Learn experimentation to test our assumptions 

# Our Average Week

## 1:1’s
If you are in my cohort or later, on a team I mentor, then every week we are going to have at least one 30 min 1:1. Our 1:1's are for your benefit, not for status updates or me telling you what to do.

## Stand Up
Stand ups should be something you want to attend! I’ve participated in many stand ups that are mindless status updates. Let’s try and keep it interesting for everyone in attendance, otherwise let’s cancel.

# Communication

*Slack:* I prefer slack to most types of communication.

*Email:* This is a better medium for longer-form communication.

*Comments on Jira Issues:* Must us my username (@magan) in the comment or it's unlikely I will see the notification. 

*In Person:* There are many types of conversations done better in person. When in doubt in-person is your best bet.

*Meetings:* I keep 99% of my calendar events public and default to allow-modify by guests; that means you can move the meeting without asking me.

*Outside of Work:* I make every effort to disconnect from work. Make sure a chat is clearly marked urgent outside of work hours if you need a quick reply.

# Work Hours
I'm usually arrive to work around 8:30 am and stay until up to 5:00-5:30 pm every day. I take lunch at 12pm-1pm every day, feel free to ask me to grab lunch if you’d like to chat. I stick to this schedule whenever possible.

# Coaching
During IU I will be coaching you on how to build products, collaborate with others, and measure the user impact of your products.

# How I Can Help You

## Empathy
Do my best to listen and understand your perspective. I am working on people not having to repeat themselves to get me to hear their idea/concern/perspective.

## Be in Your Corner
My favorite managers have "had my back" so to speak. It means I'll trust you to make your best judgments and be there for you if they don't work out. It doesn't mean I will always agree with you or approve your choices, but I'll trust that they were made with good intent.

## Resolve what you can't
I'll always lean towards letting you resolve your own issues, but when they get too much or seem unsolvable I am always here to help.

## Improve Self-Awareness
It's really hard to see yourself as you are. I promise to help you see what you are great at, as well as, what you could improve in.

# How You Can Help Me

## Help Me, Help You
I can't read minds, at least not yet. I hear some managers have that magical ability. If something is wrong in your world I can't make it better if I am not told.

## Tell Me to Hand Over the Controls
It's difficult to go from being a contributor to enabling other contributors. Tell me if I am giving you too much direction. You should feel like you're in the driver seat, not a passenger.

## Give me feedback, even when it doesn’t feel work related
Let me know if I am pronouncing your name incorrectly, or not using the correct pronouns, or I said something you feel is insensitive, in addition to work related feedback.

# My Philosophy of Work

## Leadership is Earned, Not Given
Leaders are people who others want to follow. No matter your title or role there are varying degrees of leadership in different domains. If you want to be a leader, then find ways to earn that responsibility from your co-workers, in all directions.

## Failure is the Best Teacher
If you aren't failing as person, team or product than you are pushing the limits of what you can do. It's only through pushing the current limits that you can grow.

## Less but Better
The Pareto Principle or 80/20 rule, suggest that there is a limited amount of work that will get you the majority of the benefit. It's my experience that teams with too many "priorities" often under deliver on the few things that have the highest impact. 

## Bias for Action
In my experience, it's better to start on something half-baked than it is to wait. The counterbalance to this philosophy is to be aware of the down-side risk. If you don’t act negligently, people, users included, are extremely forgiving.

## Strong Opinions, Weakly Held
We hired you because we think you can contribute to our mission to help people get jobs. That means we want you to have opinions, but we also want you to be self-aware of your assumptions.
